individual Fair Nonnegative Matrix Tri-Factorization 

This repository contains supplementary material of the iFairNMTF model. This model combines individual fairness with (unsupervised) graph clustering through a contrastive learning regularization, all integrated into a Nonnegative Matrix Tri-Factorization (NMTF) framework. Our contribution is the first research work introducing fairness into NMF. This paper is accepted at the [PAKDD 2024](https://pakdd2024.org/) conference and will be presented in the research track. In our paper entitled "Towards Cohesion-Fairness Harmony: Contrastive Regularization in Individual Fair Graph Clustering", we also investigate the implications of the real-world challenge of the clustering-fairness trade-off and provide a practical solution to this problem. 

This repository includes the pdf supplement of the paper, source codes, datasets and evaluation metrics required to reproduce our results.
